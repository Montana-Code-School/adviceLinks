Junkware Removal Tool:
Junkware Removal Tool is very help full to remove annoying free toolbars, including the unwanted changes to the homepage.
I had experience a toolbar that changed the homepage and this tool removed it and the homepage was fixed.
Malwarebytes has hired the creator of JRT and purchased the tool from him to release it on their website.
Some security software might assume JRT as a threat, Malwarebytes did that until an user left a message on their website and they modified the program to no longer recognize it as a threat. JRT looks like a command that automatically removes specific files that were marked as “junk” to remove them. https://www.malwarebytes.com/junkwareremovaltool/

Bitdefender Free
My personal opinion for Best Free security is BitDefender Free
 *It blocks certain websites like McAfee Web Advisor
 *It requires email registration just once and it permanently never asks you again compared to
free AVAST on a yearly basis.
 * No annoying pop ups or advertisements compared to AVAST & AVG
 *Bitdefender takes the least amount of resources on a machine to run it.
 *Bitdefender has been highly rated on detecting viruses and malware.
